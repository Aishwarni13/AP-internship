# 🎠 Image Carousel + Random Joke App

Welcome to my **Image Carousel + Random Joke** web app! This project combines a visually engaging **image carousel** with the fun of fetching random jokes from an API. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it demonstrates key front-end skills including DOM manipulation, API integration, and responsive design.

## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Image Carousel:**
   - Loads multiple images.
   - Slides automatically every few seconds.
   - Users can manually navigate with next/prev controls.

2. **Random Joke:**
   - Click a button to fetch a joke from an API like:
     ```
     https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke
     ```
   - Displays the joke setup and punchline dynamically.
